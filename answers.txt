1) What design decisions did you make in your rulesets that made this assignment easier or harder? Why?
    I think there are three things that I did that made this assignment easier for me. The first was having
    the twilio api easy to import. That ment adding the sms message capability easy! Additionally I think that
    storing all temperatures was a good idea, it made recalculating all the threshold violations easier. Lastly
    I think the use of compartmentalizing rules to specific actions helped the system function together.

2) Explain how the sensor_profile ruleset isolates state and processes regarding the sensor profile from other rulesets.
    The sensor_profile stores information that is unique to itself, as well as shares information that other rulesets
    need. The sensor_profile can keep track of the sensor name and location, while also maintaining/forwarding on the 
    sms number and threshold value to other pieces of the code that need them.

3) How do other rulesets use the sensor_profile to get data?
    Other rulesets have rules that listen for specific events fired off from the sensor_profile. In those events rulesets
    can find the data they need to reconfigure themselves.

4) Could they use it to store new values? How?
    Yes they can! Because data can be sent in each event, rulesets that listen for an event can grab data from that event
    and use it to generate/store additional data.
